  title: "Supervising Remote Sensing Change Detection Models with 3D Surface Semantics"
  venue: ICIP 2022
  description: "We propose Contrastive Surface-Image Pretraining (CSIP) for joint learning a latent space which extracts surface level features from optical RGB imagery which we show improves the performance in surface relevant tasks  e.g. building segmentation and change detection."
