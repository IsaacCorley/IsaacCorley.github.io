    We present [_Revisiting pre-trained remote sensing model benchmarks: resizing and normalization matters_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13456),
    which performs a fair and large-scale evaluation of remote sensing foundation models and find chip/tile size and normalization preprocessing to be paramount for achieving peak performance for each individual pretrained model.

    We present [_Single-View Height Estimation with Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Models_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13214), which trains a
    Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) conditioned on aerial imagery to estimate pixelwise height from a monocular view.
